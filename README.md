# Diabetes-Foreteller
Diabetes Foreteller is a mobile application used to calculate the probability of diabetes for a person based on the key symptoms that influence diabetes.

I have developed an android application named ‘Diabetes Foreteller’ which helps the user to assess his/her probability of having diabetes by analyzing the various symptoms of diabetes and the lifestyle of the user. Suggesting the probability of having diabetes to the user, creates an awareness and cautions him about the detrimental health effects caused by the diabetes. In addition to this, my application also recommends the preventive measures[15] for avoiding the diabetes in one’s lifetime.

**About the Dataset:**
For my application, I have made use of PIMA indians diabetes dataset. PIMA is a top-class medical institute released a diabetes dataset with the key factors that influence diabetes. The dataset provides accurate information of all the patients and provides reliability for the students/professionals to use this data in real time projects.
